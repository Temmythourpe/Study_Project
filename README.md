Reanalysis of the 100-Year Flood in Wairau River Catchment
One of New Zealand's most important rivers, the Wairau, is a key source of irrigation and water supplies for the Marlborough residential region.
Several river protection systems have been in place in the Wairau region for the past 130 years to divert floodwaters and protect the region from flooding.
Unfortunately, the pre-constructed flood control measures in the Wairau River and its tributaries have failed to protect the flood plains owing to extraordinary 
extreme events like the 1983 flood event resulted in an initial peak flow of 7000 m3/s, a 1 in 150-year return period event.
The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining a fair estimate of the area's precipitation data for flood forecasting and rainfall model recommendations, 
as well as to investigate the surface-groundwater interaction during the flood. The objectives are to estimate flood event parameters, interpolate and investigate the 
sensitivity of each strategy to catchment precipitation, and then analyze groundwater reaction data.
